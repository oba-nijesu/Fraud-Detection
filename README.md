# Fraud-Detection
A machine learning–powered web application that analyzes credit card transactions in real time and predicts the likelihood of fraud. Built with Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn, this app uses feature engineering, label encoding, and a trained classification model to deliver instant fraud insights based on user inputs.

Key Features
* User-friendly web interface via Streamlit
* Accepts transaction details such as merchant, category, amount, location, gender, job, UNIX time, etc.
* Automatically encodes categorical fields using LabelEncoder
* Real-time fraud prediction with trained ML model
* Lightweight and fast — ideal for fintech demos and deployment

Tech Stack
* Python · Streamlit · Scikit-learn · Pandas · NumPy
* Machine Learning (Classification Model)

Goal
To build a production-ready fraud detection system suitable for real-world fintech applications, with extensibility for API or mobile integration.
